# super-tic-tac-toe

I saw [this video by Vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Na3a1ZrX7c) and decided to make it

Esentially you play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, with 9 smaller games of Tic-Tac-Toe inside!
The first player can pick any spot on any board. After they pick a spot on a board, all the other boards are locked other than the coresponding board on the main board.
If you win a smaller game of tic-tac-toe, you claim that board. First to 3 in a row on the main board wins!
